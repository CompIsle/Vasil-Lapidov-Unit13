<h1> Design notes </h1>

Layout including sizes.
Typography  includes fonts, size and positioning of the text.
Colours include what colours are used.
Two designs are needed, a main and an alternative.

<h2> Layout </h2>

I used the same size for the pictures of products on the home page. 
The logo is the same size in every page it is produced.
nav bar is 100% width.


<h2> Typography </h2>

I used the same font on every page so it stays professional.
The size of the text is changed only on headings.
I positioned almost all of the texts in the middle.


<h2> Colours </h2>

The colours used in the website are Grey, Lightgrey, Darkgrey and some images for background.


<h1> Requirements</h1>

<h2> Owner requirements </h2>
 The owner needs to know what product is he going to sell. He needs to consider the payment for Designers, Developers and Maintainers. He needs to choose the domain for his website.
<h2> Maintainers </h2>
 They need to check the code if it is up to date. Is the code well structured. They also need to consider the file structure and that not only the code, but the documentation is up to date as well.

Visitors need an easy navigation, good information about products and they have to be satisfied with the style of the website.

They need instructions and clear explanations of spacific elements the owner wants for the website.
