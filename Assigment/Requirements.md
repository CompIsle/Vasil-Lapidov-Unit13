<h1>Requirements</h1>


<h2>Owner</h2>

We met owner's requirements by choosing a product for the website. 
We chose to sell phones because we wanted the website to sell technology.

<h2>Visitor</h2>

For visitor's requirements we need a simple and easy navigation so we made a navigation bar that links to all pages. We also need good colours for every visitor of the website that's why we chose to use grey and black for our website.

<h2>Designer</h2>

The designer requirements we met by creating 2 wireframes for the website, wireframe1 and wireframe2.
wireframe1 was chosen over wireframe2 because it has a simple navigation and colours. With wireframe1 we easily met the visitor requirements as we thing it is important that visitor give a good feedback for our website.

<h2>Maintainers</h2>

The requirements for the Maintainers were met by crating a structured folder of the whole documentation and
a file of all the assets used for my website (photos, links etc.)
